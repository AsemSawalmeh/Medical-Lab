A fully functional program for a Medical Testing Lab , with fully functional database to store patients, employees, test results and so on....

This program is built simply by creating a database in MySQL (MedicalLab.SQL),connecting the SQL database to Java using the IntelliJ Library(mysql-connector-java-5.1.47).
Then an interface was made for every table in the database with delete, add , and edit column for most of the tables.

The main functionallity of the program is to store patient's visits to the medical lab and save the tests they took for them to get the result later,
there is also a primitive pdf printing functionallity which prints out full details of a patient's visit(using itextpdf.maven).

The program also stores employees' and Doctors' information for them to be referenced(if eligible) in a patient's receipt.

Finally the program can do analysis on some of the data like average results for a certain test , average salary for employees in a certain medical branch etc......
